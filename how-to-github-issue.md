# What do do if you find an error
Find an error in the tutorial sheets, think something could be explained better, or have an idea for a new problem? By pointing out errors / making suggestions, you will help improve the content for your fellow classmates and earn the eternal gratefulness of the module staff. Here is how you go about doing that:

## Email the teaching staff
The easiest way to get an error fixed is to send a description and screenshot to one of the maths teaching staff. For this term (2020-2021), Thomas Godden will be updating the sheets so send him an email at: tg819@ic.ac.uk

## Submitting a GitHub issue
However, the best way to suggest edits is through GitHub issues.

### (Step 0: Open the GitHub repository)
Head to: [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/DE1-Engineering-Mathematics/module-resources) to see the source documents for all the tutorial sheets. This is where we create the issue. _(Note: you will need a GitHub account)_

### Step 1: Note where the error is
After finding an error, make sure to note which sheet, problem and part the error is in. Getting a screenshot is even better!

### Step 2: Searching existing issues
It's a great idea to search the [existing issues](https://github.com/DE1-Engineering-Mathematics/module-resources/issues) to see if someone else has already noticed this. Head to the repository Do this by switching to the issue tab in GitHub and searching `Sheet # Problem #` (or something similar).

### Step 4: Fill out your new issue
Pretty self explanatory, try to keep the title format `sheet #, problem #, part #` as that will make it easy to search!

Hit submit and you are all done! Thanks for helping make the sheets better! If you save the url, or remember what you titled the issue, you can come back and check to see when/how your issue has been resolved. (GitHub should also notify you)
